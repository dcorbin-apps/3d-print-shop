# 3D Print Shop Development Plan

What is still to do. Finished work is not recorded here - the reasoning behind each decision lives
in `AIDEV-NOTE`s beside the code it explains, and the rest is in git.

See [design/3d-print-shop.md](design/3d-print-shop.md) for the design this is working towards, and
[design/octoprint-sim.md](design/octoprint-sim.md) for the stand-in printer the tests run against.

## Remaining Work

### The service

- [ ] The shop can say when IT is in trouble, rather than only what each printer is doing. A store
  or data-directory fault is nobody's printer's fault and now stops nothing, so a log line is all there is -
  and nothing a client or an operator asks answers "the shop is not well". The contract has no
  shop-level status at all: `printers()` is the closest thing, and a fault that touches every
  printer at once has nowhere to be seen
- [ ] Positional filaments, when there is a printer with more than one extruder. Scheduling uses
  only a job's FIRST filament today, which is right for one extruder and wrong for several: the
  index is the extruder the slicer assigned, so `[red, blue]` and `[blue, red]` are different
  requirements. `startsWith()` in `packages/server/src/selection.ts` is the one place to revisit

### Security

- [ ] Sessions do not survive a restart, so restarting the shop logs everybody out. In memory is
  the honest first answer - they are the shop's rather than the file's, and a file of them is a
  second thing to get the mode of right - but a shop restarted by an update at 2am is a wall display
  asking to be logged in to in the morning
- [ ] Nobody can change their own password. `caller password` is an operator at a terminal, which is
  right for setting one and wrong for the person who wants to change theirs


### The page in a browser

- [ ] The verdict a person gives - the one thing that frees a bed - is still `job approve` at a
  terminal. Adding a printer is the only thing the page can change today, and judging a print is the
  one worth having next: a bed is held until somebody says, and a page somebody is already watching
  the print on is where they would say it

### Installation

- [ ] Publish `@3d-print-shop/*` to a registry. Until then a client depends on a checkout of this
  repository sitting beside it — the client it was written for reaches it as
  `portal:../3d-print-shop/packages/client`, which cannot survive a fresh clone that has no shop
  next door

### Beyond one printer

- [ ] Multi-printer routing — the store and the foreman already carry several, and `printableNow`
  answers per printer; what is untested is a shop actually running two at once
- [ ] Report a printer's own state — bed, temperature, filament — rather than only what an operator
  said was loaded. Do NOT design around SpoolManager: it existed once on this machine's printer and
  is gone, so assume the machine cannot answer and the operator does
